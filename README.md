Include top file from design folder to verification environment to run the test in Questasim.
Implementation of verification environment of parallel calculator 
Course: Funvtional hardware verification (COEN 6541)
University: Concordia University
The complete project is explained in project report.
Project Description:
The main objective of this project is to write a verification functional test plan based on a design specification, 
creating a verification environment for the given design using the test plan so that it can be reusable for multiple designs and 
to find errors in the design. In this project, Calc 1, Calc 2and Calc 3 designs are verified using different verification tests in the 
same environment that is created. Different test scenarios were tested and detailed description of the results are provided.
System Verilog is used to code the project and is performed on Questasim.
